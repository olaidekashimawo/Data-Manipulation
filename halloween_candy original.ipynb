    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, your job will be to clean and wrangle data from a survey of Halloween candy to prepare it for a machine learning project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed all the tasks in the notebook, save your notebook as `halloween_candy`, and verify that all the tests pass in CodeGrade.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you that are more comfortable with using Pandas, I have also provided extra optional data analysis questions at the end of the assignment for more practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set that we will be using is the 2017 Halloween Candy Hierarchy data set as discussed in this [boingboing](https://boingboing.net/2017/10/30/the-2017-halloween-candy-hiera.html) article.  You can also read more about the data in the [Science Creative Quarterly](https://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the rating instructions from the survey:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Basically, consider that feeling you get when you receive this item in your Halloween haul. Does it make you really happy (JOY)? Or is it something that you automatically place in the junk pile (DESPAIR)? MEH for indifference, and you can leave blank if you have no idea what the item is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the original data set has been slightly altered from its original state, and if you wanted to perform any analysis for future projects, you would need to download the data directly from the links above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is a great example of a messy data set, especially since they allowed respondents to enter text for a number of the fields. Also, note that some of the comments in the file might be considered inappropriate to some readers but cleaning this type of data is normal in a lot of data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Show Work</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you must show your work.  Students submissions are spot checked manually throughout the term to verify that they are not hard coding the answer from looking only in the file or in CodeGrade's expected output.  If this is seen, the student's answer will be manually marked wrong and their grade will be changed to reflect this. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the answer to Q1, the mean of a specific column, is 22:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# correct way\n",
    "Q1 = df['column_name'].mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "# incorrect way\n",
    "Q1 = 22 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our End Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Our end goal for this project is to clean the data so that we could then create a machine learning model. We want to see if we are able to predict a person's gender based purely on their candy preferences. Although, you will not be creating a model for this assignment, only cleaning the data. The results of the models that I used after cleaning the data are provided at the end of this notebook.\n",
